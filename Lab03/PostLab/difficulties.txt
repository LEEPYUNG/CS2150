For this post lab I implemented my code from LAB2 to create a linked list for a stack. 

-I tried to first create a singly linked list, but this was diffilcult because I didn't know how to access the last item on the stack. So I just used a doubly linked list and used the TAIL pointer to get the top of the stack.
-When trying to use a singly linked list I tried to use the iterator to get the last node in the stack. But I had issues getting the iterator working. The code became long and arduous to follow so I ended up not using it and just using the TAIL pointer as my "iterator".
